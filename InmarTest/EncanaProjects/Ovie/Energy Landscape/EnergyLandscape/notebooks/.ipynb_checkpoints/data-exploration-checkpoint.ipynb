      "TITLE: Trump Asks Saudi Arabia to Increase Oil Production\n",
      "\n",
      "CONTENT: U.S. President Donald Trump on Saturday said he asked Saudi Arabia to significantly boost its oil production to bring down crude prices. “I am asking that Saudi Arabia increase oil production, maybe up to 2,000,000 barrels,” Mr. Trump said in a tweet, citing a conversation with Saudi King Salman bin Abdulaziz. “Prices to high! He has agreed!” the tweet said, citing “turmoil &amp; disfunction” in Iran and Venezuela. It wasn’t clear whether Mr. Trump was saying the king agreed that prices were too high or that the kingdom would increase oil output. In an official statement posted on the state-run Saudi Press Agency, the kingdom said King Salman spoke to Mr. Trump, but gave no mention of the 2 million barrels of extra production the American leader tweeted about. “During the call, the two leaders stressed the need to make efforts to maintain the stability of oil markets and the growth of the global economy,” it said. Whether Saudi Arabia would be able to raise output by the amount Mr. Trump suggested is debatable, according to officials. “This is just simply not doable. Saudi Arabia cannot bring this capacity online that fast and sustain it for 90 days,” a senior Saudi oil official said. “Highly doubt either the energy minister or the chief executive of Aramco agreed to this,” the official added, referring to state oil company Saudi Arabian Oil Co. Saudi Arabia has already ramped up output significantly following last week’s decision by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and a group of non-OPEC producers led by Russia to do so. Oil prices on Friday rose to another multiyear high, amid concern over declining crude inventories and possible supply disruptions. Light, sweet crude for August delivery settled up 1% to $74.15 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange, the highest settle since November 2014. Brent, the global benchmark, rose 2% to $79.44 a barrel. Saudi Arabia, the world’s energy powerhouse, moved again last week to reassure oil consumers that it would tap its vast spare capacity to make up for any additional demand and supply shortfall as Venezuela’s production drops, but people in the industry say the kingdom is already close to its comfortable operational production limits. The kingdom is now pumping around 10.6 million barrels a day and says it has about 2 million barrels a day of spare capacity, which energy minister Khalid al-Falih repeatedly said could be brought on immediately should the market need it. The kingdom has often said its policy is to maintain spare output capacity of 1.5 million to 2 million barrels a day at all times to cope with emergency shortfalls. People familiar with the matter have previously said the kingdom, which maintains the largest portion of spare capacity within OPEC, can only sustain output of around 12.5 million barrels a day for a very short period. “On paper, you can argue it is doable, even though also on paper there is always about 10% of one country’s production down so it is unrealistic to expect the kingdom can actually pump that much and maintain it for 90 days,” a senior oil official said. Other Saudi officials said pumping beyond 11 million barrels a day may also involve extracting more costly crude. “Saudi Arabia does not really like going beyond 11 million barrels day and has no intension of expanding its current production capacity. It is expensive, and it is really not needed,” another Saudi official said. The kingdom has been typically cautious about suggesting the need for more crude capacity recent years, mainly to avoid oil market volatility. Saudi Aramco is already spending billions of dollars to address declines from its old fields and maintain overall oil output capacity at around 12 million barrels a day. The company is currently focusing on its offshore fields, and is planning to boost offshore production by around 1 million barrels a day by 2022-23. Last year, Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman said that the kingdom could raise its capacity to 20 million barrels a day. In 2008, the kingdom said it planned to reach 15 million barrels a day in response to a price spike to $147 a barrel. But a few years later, the kingdom said it was unlikely to proceed with this move as expansion plans in other producing countries such as Iraq and Brazil would likely be enough to satisfy world markets.
