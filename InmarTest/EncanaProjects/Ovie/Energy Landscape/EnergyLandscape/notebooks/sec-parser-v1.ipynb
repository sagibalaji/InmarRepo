For technology licensed to third parties, revenues totaled approximately $79 million in 2019.

Using definitions and guidelines established by the American Petroleum Institute, ExxonMobil’s 2019 worldwide environmental expenditures for all such preventative and remediation steps, including ExxonMobil’s share of equity company expenditures, were $5.2 billion, of which $4.0 billion were included in expenses with the remainder in capital expenditures.
